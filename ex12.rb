# Beginning of Ex12

  # print "Give me a number: "
  # number = gets.chomp.to_i

  # bigger = number * 100
  # puts "A bigger number is #{bigger}."

  # print "Give me another number: "
  # another = gets.chomp
  # number = another.to_f

  # smaller = number / 100
  # puts "A smaller number is #{smaller}."

# Notes
# to_i - makes the recieved input as a integer. number = gets.chomp.to_i - This puts whatever number (inputted number) as a integer.
# to_f - This makes the number inputted a fraction.
# Test program Ex12
  #  print "I need money, how much can you give me: "
  #  money = gets.chomp.to_i

  #  returned_money = money * 0.1
  #  puts "Thank you! I can give you back this much #{returned_money}."

  #  puts "Now I can afford my eletric bill!"
