#Beginning of Ex5 - More Variables and Printing
# " (Double Quotes) makes a string around a set of text. A string is how you make something
#that your program might give to a human. You print strings, save strings to files
#send strings to web servers, and many other things.
#strings are really handy, so in this exercise you will learn how to make strings that have variables
#embedded in them. You embed variables inside a string by using a special #{} sequence
#and then put the variable you want inside the {} characters. This tells Ruby, "Hey, this string
#needs to be formatted. Put these variables in there."

  # my_name = 'Christian Massie'
  # my_age = 25.0 # written in 2017 ;)
  # my_height = 66.0 # inches
  # my_weight = 138.0 # lbs
  # my_eyes = 'Blue'
  # my_teeth = 'White'
  # my_hair = 'Black'



  # puts "Lets talk about #{my_name}"
  # puts "He's #{my_height} inches tall."
  # puts "He's #{my_weight} pounds heavy."
  # puts "Actually...Thats really not heavy."
  # puts "He's got #{my_eyes} eyes and #{my_hair} hair."
  # puts "His teeth are usually #{my_teeth} depending on the soda."

  # puts "If I add my age #{my_age}, my height #{my_height}, and my weight #{my_weight} I get #{my_age + my_height + my_weight}."
