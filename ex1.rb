#Beginning of Ex4 - Variables and Names
#Equals acts as a definition for it to pull from. Typical variable names in Ruby
#consist of I, X, J. You are not limited to these however.
#the use of 4.0 is a floating point number. It could be used as 4, but its better to use
#4.0 as the number to make it floating point.
#use of _ allows for longer names and easier identification.

  # cars = 100
  # space_in_a_car = 4
  # drivers = 30
  # passengers = 90
  # cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
  # cars_driven = drivers
  # carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
  # average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

  # puts "There are #{cars} cars available."
  # puts "There are only #{drivers} drivers available."
  # puts "There will be #{cars_not_driven} empty cars today."
  # puts "We can transport #{carpool_capacity} people today."
  # puts "We have #{passengers} to carpool today."
  # puts "We need to put about #{average_passengers_per_car} people in each car."

#Beginning of Ex5 - More Variables and Printing
# " (Double Quotes) makes a string around a set of text. A string is how you make something
#that your program might give to a human. You print strings, save strings to files
#send strings to web servers, and many other things.
#strings are really handy, so in this exercise you will learn how to make strings that have variables
#embedded in them. You embed variables inside a string by using a special #{} sequence
#and then put the variable you want inside the {} characters. This tells Ruby, "Hey, this string
#needs to be formatted. Put these variables in there."

  # my_name = 'Christian Massie'
  # my_age = 25.0 # written in 2017 ;)
  # my_height = 66.0 # inches
  # my_weight = 138.0 # lbs
  # my_eyes = 'Blue'
  # my_teeth = 'White'
  # my_hair = 'Black'



  # puts "Lets talk about #{my_name}"
  # puts "He's #{my_height} inches tall."
  # puts "He's #{my_weight} pounds heavy."
  # puts "Actually...Thats really not heavy."
  # puts "He's got #{my_eyes} eyes and #{my_hair} hair."
  # puts "His teeth are usually #{my_teeth} depending on the soda."

  # puts "If I add my age #{my_age}, my height #{my_height}, and my weight #{my_weight} I get #{my_age + my_height + my_weight}."
