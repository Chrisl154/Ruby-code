#Beginning of Ex4 - Variables and Names
#Equals acts as a definition for it to pull from. Typical variable names in Ruby
#consist of I, X, J. You are not limited to these however.
#the use of 4.0 is a floating point number. It could be used as 4, but its better to use
#4.0 as the number to make it floating point.
#use of _ allows for longer names and easier identification.

  # cars = 100
  # space_in_a_car = 4
  # drivers = 30
  # passengers = 90
  # cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
  # cars_driven = drivers
  # carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
  # average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

  # puts "There are #{cars} cars available."
  # puts "There are only #{drivers} drivers available."
  # puts "There will be #{cars_not_driven} empty cars today."
  # puts "We can transport #{carpool_capacity} people today."
  # puts "We have #{passengers} to carpool today."
  # puts "We need to put about #{average_passengers_per_car} people in each car."
